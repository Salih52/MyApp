I was responsible for developing and maintaining    full-stack web applications using <strong>Angular</strong> on the frontend and    <strong>Spring Boot</strong> on the backend.    This experience enhanced my ability to build scalable and maintainable software solutions.  </p>  <p>    Most recently, I completed an internship at <strong>Ercal Group</strong>,    where I worked on improving the companyâ€™s internal <strong>CRM systems</strong>,    enhancing functionality and performance of critical modules.  </p>  <p>    I have also worked on various personal and academic projects, always striving to improve my    skills in <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Docker</strong>,    <strong>MySQL/PostgreSQL</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and more.    I enjoy learning new technologies and building practical, real-world solutions    with clean architecture and efficient code.  </p>",
